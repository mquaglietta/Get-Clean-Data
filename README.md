# Getting and Cleaning Data
This repository contains the scripts and data required to pass the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome) final exam on Coursera

## Project Scope
The goal of this project was to create one R script called run_analysis.R that, taken data from [UCI HAR Datasets](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
